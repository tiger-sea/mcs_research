# Whether the Weather Has Impacts on Daily Heart Rate Variability Over Seven Years

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
In recent years, various symptoms, such as headache, which are widely believed to be caused by meteorological changes, have been attracting attention and are referred to as meteoropathy. Meteoropathy is considered as a new disease or syndrome [meteoQ] that represents any pathological reactions in some way related to weather conditions, and it could occur to people who have diseases which are sensitive to weather changes and even healthy people. Some people troubling in meteoropathy do not notice they have symptoms related to meteorological factors, hence the symptoms or intensity in individuals are different from person to person, and it is difficult to be diagnosed as meteoropathy.

Indeed, according to a survey conducted by a Japanese company Weathernews.inc in 2020 and 2023, considerable number of people reported they are suffering from meteoropathy [weathernews2020, 2023] ???Pi chart???. For example, more than half of the participants in the survey have experienced headache on days with bad weather. Besides this, dizziness, joint pain, and stiff neck are also symptoms which are mainly mentioned by them ?barplot?. The number of people who perceived suffering from meteoropathy has been increasing ?Figuretsukau?. Additionally, a study showed that nearly 30% of people in the world have experienced symptoms associated with meteoropathy. [meteoropathy:a review]. A few services have launched to provide prediction of the onset of meteoropathy over the past several years [zutool and weathernews] to deal with the symptoms in advance in Japan. Consequently, numerous people are interested in why the symptoms appear and how we can address them in order to maintain a healthy condition.

\section{Prior Studies}
There have been several studies that examined relationship between specific diseases and meteorological factors. L. Ma et al.

Although various studies have sought to understand the causes of meteoropathy, they are still not fully clarified.

\section{Aim of the Study} : good for now
To our knowledge, few previous studies have conducted an analysis of long-term quantitative data related to HRV parameters, some of which are related to the dynamics of the autonomic nervous system, which has been suggested to be affected by meteorological factors in several studies. In the current study, we examined the association between HRV parameters and meteorological factors in order to assess which meteorological factors have impacts on them, based on ECG data as quantitative measures, which are closely associated with changes in our health condition. Additionally, we discussed how we manage the symptoms and explored the future developments in order to contribute to maintaining health.

Achieving these aims would provide valuable insights into which meteorological factors influence HRV parameters' dynamics.
