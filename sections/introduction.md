# Whether the Weather Has Impacts on Daily Heart Rate Variability Over Seven Years

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
In recent years, various symptoms, such as headache, which are widely believed to be caused by meteorological changes, have been attracting attention and are referred to as meteoropathy. Meteoropathy is considered as a new disease or syndrome [meteoQ] that represents any pathological reactions in some way related to weather conditions, and it could occur to people who have diseases which are sensitive to weather changes and even healthy people. 天気痛は特定の決まった症状が無く，自分がそれに悩んでいると気づかない人も中にはいる(なんか調子悪いなとか)．なぜなら人によって症状の種類や強度がばらばらであり特定も難しいから．

Indeed, according to a survey conducted by a Japanese company Weathernews.inc in 2020 and 2023, considerable number of people reported they are suffering from meteoropathy [weathernews2020, 2023] __Pi chart???__. For example, more than half of the participants in the survey have experienced headache on days with bad weather. Besides this, dizziness, joint pain, and stiff neck are also symptoms which are mainly mentioned by them __bar plot?__. The number of people who perceived suffering from meteoropathy has been increasing (__Figure???__). また，世界に目を向けても，30%以上の人が天気痛のような症状を経験したことがあると報告する研究もある[meteoropathy:a review]. A few services have launched to provide prediction of the onset of meteoropathy over the past several years [頭ツールとweathernews] to deal with the symptoms in advance in Japan. Consequently, numerous people are interested in why the symptoms appear and how we can address them in order to maintain a healthy condition.

\section{Prior Studies}
There have been several studies that examined relationship between specific diseases and meteorological factors. L. Ma et al. [xxxx] mentioned that aspiration diseases....

And some studies showed that 天気痛を自覚する人の中でも，特に女性の方が天気痛を自覚しやすい傾向がある．

Also, some studies evaluated relation between health condition and meteorological factors with healthy and sick people utilizing questionnaire or diary based report.

In many previous papers, the researchers have stated results that patients are affected by weather, but some of those results are not consistent. For instance, ... That would be because of difference of methodology. 例えば．．．

Although various studies have sought to understand the causes of meteoropathy, they are still not fully clarified.

\section{Aim of the Study}
To our knowledge, few previous studies have conducted analysis of long-term quantitative data involving healthy individuals. In the current study, we examined the association between HRV parameters and meteorological factors in order to determine which meteorological factors have impacts on our health condition change based on ECG data as quantitative measures. Additionally, we discussed how we manage the symptoms and explored the future developments in order to contribute to maintaining health.
