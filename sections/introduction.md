# Whether the Weather Has Impacts on Daily Heart Rate Variability Over Seven Years

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
In recent years, various symptoms, such as headache, which are widely believed to be caused by meteorological changes, have been attracting attention and are referred to as meteoropathy. Meteoropathy is considered as a new disease or syndrome [meteoQ] that represents any pathological reactions in some way related to weather conditions, and it could occur to people who have diseases which are sensitive to weather changes and even healthy people. Some people troubling in meteoropathy do not notice they have symptoms related to meteorological factors, hence the symptoms or intensity in individuals are different from person to person, and it is difficult to be diagnosed as meteoropathy.

Indeed, according to a survey conducted by a Japanese company Weathernews.inc in 2020 and 2023, considerable number of people reported they are suffering from meteoropathy [weathernews2020, 2023] ???Pi chart???. For example, more than half of the participants in the survey have experienced headache on days with bad weather. Besides this, dizziness, joint pain, and stiff neck are also symptoms which are mainly mentioned by them as shown in Figure \ref{fig:survey}. The number of people who perceived suffering from meteoropathy has been increasing ?Figuretsukau?. Additionally, a study showed that nearly 30% of people in the world have experienced symptoms associated with meteoropathy. [meteoropathy:a review]. A few services have launched to provide prediction of the onset of meteoropathy over the past several years [zutool and weathernews] to deal with the symptoms in advance in Japan. Consequently, numerous people are interested in why the symptoms appear and how we can address them in order to maintain a healthy condition.

\section{Prior Studies}
There have been several studies that examined relationship between specific diseases and meteorological factors. L. Ma et al. [6] and Costilla-Esquivel A et al. [7] mentioned that the number of patients of respiratory diseases are influenced by meteorological factors. The former reported that the factors having a greater impact on the number of patients with respiratory diseases are daily minimum temperature, minimum atmospheric pressure, minimum wind speed, and total precipitation. In contrast, the latter insisted that weekly minimum temperature, median relative humidity, and total precipitation were effective factors on the number of weekly patients of respiratory diseases. Although minimum temperature is one of common factors in both studies, the latter concluded it could have a reducing effect on the target variable, conflicting the former study's conclusion.

Hamida Azzouzi and Linda Ichchou [8] and Fagerlund AJ et al. [9] evaluated pain intensity level associating with meteorological factors. Hamida Azzouzi and Linda Ichchou examined pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis using patients' pain assessment from computerized medical record. They stated that minimum temperature and atmospheric pressure were negatively correlated to pain intensity. Besides, Fagerlund AJ et al. focused on pain intensity with fibromyalgia, using data from government public database. They reported low atmospheric pressure and high relative humidity induced stronger pain intensity. There is a common factor between the two previous studies, however, few meteorological factors overlapped.

In addition to effects on physical body, mental health could be changed by weather. For example, Lee M et al. [10] described maximum temperature and relative humidity caused fatigue, utilizing diary form questionnaire. They also suggested that women's health condition were more sensitive than men to weather change. Additionally, Lickiewicz J et al. [11] also investigated mental health aggravation with psychiatric setting data. They pointed that decrease of atmospheric pressure and increase of temperature worsened mental health condition. They suggested weather change in macro scale, such as air mass and weather fronts also could have an effect on our health condition.

Although the previous studies mentioned above focused on certain diseases, there are some previous studies with healthy individuals who perceived weather-related change in their condition. Mazza M et al. [meteo-Q] proposed a concept Meteorosensitivity defined as "biological susceptibility to feel the effect of particular atmospherical events on [the] mind and body" and a questionnaire METEO-Q to detect meteoropathy. Besides, Oniszczenko W [12] assessed the relationship between meteoropathy and meteorosensitivity with questionnaire METEO-Q [meteo-Q], and showed that a large correlation was found between them among women. Therefore, the more sensitive they are to changes in weather, the more possibly they are to experience meteoropathy symptoms.

Furthermore, other than the study carried out by Lee M et al [10], several studies described that women were easier to perceive weather changes and more severe symptoms, and it affected on onset of meteoropathy. However, Bellini S et al [13] conducted a survey about meteoropathy using METEO-Q with adult outpatients, and they reported that men showed higher level of meteoropathy than women.

In many previous papers, the researchers have stated results that patients are affected by weather, but some of those results are not consistent. For instance, ... That would be because of difference of methodology, such as questionnaire, daily diary, public database, period of data collection (daily or weekly的な). Focusing on atmospheric pressure, some concluded it had positive effect, but other insisted not effective or negatively effective. The difference between cited previous studies are shown in Table \ref{}.

\section{Aim of the Study} : good for now
Although various studies have sought to understand the causes of meteoropathy, they are still not fully clarified. To our knowledge, few previous studies have conducted an analysis of long-term quantitative data related to \ac{HRV} parameters. Some of HRV parameters closely associated with changes in our health condition are related to the dynamics of the autonomic nervous system, which has been suggested to be affected by meteorological factors in several studies. In the current study, we examined the association between HRV parameters and meteorological factors in order to assess which meteorological factors have impacts on them, based on \ac{ECG} data as quantitative measures. Additionally, we discussed how we manage the symptoms and explored the future developments in order to contribute to maintaining health.


Achieving these aims would provide valuable insights into which meteorological factors influence HRV parameters' dynamics.
