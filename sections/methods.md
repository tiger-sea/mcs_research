\section{Data Collection}

\subsection{ECG Data}
The ECG data utilized in this study was collected in a bathtub environment for special experiment of ECG measurement in the University of Aizu. The purpose of this setup was to integrate the experiment into regular daily activities without interfering with them. Daily data collection started from July 2017 to July 2024, covering approximately 7 years in total, though with some missing days. The subject was a healthy adult man whose height is 172 cm, and body weight ranged between 60 and 64 kg, which depends on seasonal condition. In the bathtub environment, bathing condition was typically kept nearly identical conditions, specifically, amount of bath water was about 180 liters, and the temperature was set between 37 and 40 degrees Celsius depending on the season or health condition [my paper]

For ECG measurement, a self made equipment of biosignal measurement unit was adopted to record ECG data while the subject was taking bath by Lead-I\hspace{-1.2pt}I. There were three electrodes on the bathtub wall, one was located on the bathtub wall close to subject's left leg, and the others were placed on it close to subject's right arm and leg respectively as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:bath env}. As mentioned earlier in this section, this measurement method minimally interferes with normal daily life.

\subsection{Meteorological Factors}
Daily meteorological data corresponding to the ECG data was gathered from the Japan Meteorological Agency's database [xxx]. The location of monitoring point by the Japan Meteorological Agency was Aizu-Wakamatsu city, Fukushima, Japan [address pdf]. In this study, 12 meteorological factors were collected, and which include maximum, minimum, or mean representative values for each meteorological factor as shown below Table \ref{table:weather factors}.

    Relative humidity (\%) & Mean \\
                           & Minimum\\
    Sea-level atmospheric pressure (hPa) & Mean \\
                                         & Minimum \\
    Precipitation (mm) & Total \\
                       & Hourly maximum \\
    Snowfall (cm) & Total \\
    Sunshine duration (hour) & Total \\
    Wind speed (m/sec) & Mean \\
    \hline

\end{table}

According to statistical guideline of the Japan Meteorological Agency's database, calculation protocol of representative values are defined as follows [pdf]:
