The main goal of the study was to assess the relationship between meteorological factors and \ac{HRV} parameters which were derived from daily \ac{ECG} measurement taken while bathing. This research utilized a unique quantitative long-term dataset of HRV parameters to investigate what meteorological factors influence them. By adapting \ac{SSM}, the study accounted for time-dependent patterns in the data to estimate the impacts of meteorological data such as temperature, relative humidity, sea-level atmospheric pressure, precipitation, snowfall, sunshine duration, and wind speed on multiple HRV parameters. Key findings indicated that some of temperature-related and precipitation-related factors, including mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures, were estimated as the most influence on HRV parameters, exhibiting relatively large \ac{MAP} estimation values or consistently positive/negative credible intervals. Additionally, humidity, sea-level atmospheric pressure, and wind speed also demonstrated consistent credible intervals and moderate MAP estimation values for certain HRV parameters. In contrast, meteorological factors such as snowfall and sunshine duration showed more limited association with fewer HRV parameters. These findings suggest that specific meteorological factors may fluctuate certain HRV parameters, some of which are related to \ac{ANS} activities, providing valuable insights into environmental influences on health regulation and supporting the results and proposals of previous studies.
