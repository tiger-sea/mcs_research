\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

First and foremost, I am deeply grateful to my supervisor Professor Chen for his tireless support and encouragement. Ever since I first encountered his research during my high school years, I have been inspired and motivated to pursue my own research activities such as publication for a conference. His numerous pieces of advice he generously provided, regardless the time, have been invaluable to me.

Moreover, I would like to thank to many staffs in the university, including referees, lab staffs, and other professors. My student life would not have been have been possible without their support.

Lastly, I extend my heartfelt thanks to my family and many friends. To my family, I am deeply grateful for all the support and care I received. To my friends, their unique experiences, which I do not possess, have inspired me countless times, stimulating my curiosity. Once again, I express my sincere thanks to many people.
