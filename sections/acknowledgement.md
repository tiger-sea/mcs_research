\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

First and foremost, I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, Professor Chen, for his tireless support and encouragement. Ever since I first encountered his research during my high school years, I was inspired by his work. This inspiration, coupled with his guidance, motivated me to pursue my own research activities, such as publishing at a conference-an invaluable experience. His numerous pieces of advice he generously provided, regardless of the time, have been indispensable to me.

Moreover, I would like to express my gratitude to the university staff, including referees, lab staff, and other professors. My student life would not have been possible without their support.

Lastly, I extend my heartfelt thanks to my family and many friends. I am deeply grateful to my family for their unwavering support and care throughout this unique journey. Their encouragement and understanding have provided me with countless precious experiences. To my friends, I truly appreciate their diverse perspectives and unique experiences, which I do not possess, as they have broadened my horizons and stimulated my curiosity.

Once again, I express my sincere thanks to many people.
