\chapter{Discussion}

The purpose of the study was to analyze the relationship between meteorological factors and HRV parameters. We collected daily ECG data under the specified conditions and meteorological data from the database. Our analysis aimed to identify which factors have an influence on HRV. By identifying meteorological factors that could have an effect on HRV parameters, the authors considered that these findings might provide insights supporting future research on physiological responses to environmental conditions. 

Many researchers have investigated the effects of meteorological factors on certain diseases such as papers mentioned in the introduction, generally utilizing qualitative data sources, including questionnaires and diaries. Few researchers have examined the impact of various meteorological factors on quantitative biological indicators like HRV parameters fluctuations. The effects of weather elements could be analyzed by using SSM, which is capable to account for time-dependent patterns.

Building on these key findings, we interpret the significance of each meteorological factor by exploring how variations correspond to changes in HRV parameters, as indicated by the MAP estimation values. Specifically, a 1-sigma increase in each meteorological factor corresponds to a MAP estimation values change in HRV, providing a basis for assessing the relative influence of each weather element. Below, we discuss the results and their physical implications, focusing on the key meteorological factors and their potential impacts on HRV parameters.

Temperature, including mean, maximum, and minimum values, emerge as a significant factor influencing HRV parameters. For example, for heart rate, a 1-sigma increase in mean and maximum temperature was associated with an increase of MAP estimation value of 1.3-1.5 bpm in heart rate. Additionally, also for several HRV parameters, some statistics of temperature tended to be estimated that the MAP estimation values were larger than the other meteorological factors, implying its impacts for our body condition change were relatively considerable. 

This suggests that ambient temperature may induce reactions in body thermal regulation such as SNS. In general, temperature shows more substantial effects on our body than other meteorological factors, which might be explained by homeostasis. Keeping our body temperature constantly is essential in human survival, including sweating in human for heat-defence response [skin temp]. In many cases, the ambient temperature works as an element which could stress our human body, especially people suffering from certain diseases [between extreme]. T. Haritini et al. have examined an association between extreme temperatures and public health in Cyprus, concluding the mortality was strongly associated with high temperature weather [health impact assess]. Based on those previous studies, this study's results were consistent with them and reasonable. For several HRV parameters, some statistics of temperature were estimated that the MAP values were larger than the other meteorological factors, implying its impacts for our body condition change were relatively considerable.
