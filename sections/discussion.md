\chapter{Discussion}

The purpose of the study was to analyze the relationship between meteorological factors and HRV parameters. We collected daily ECG data under the specified conditions and meteorological data from the database. Our analysis aimed to identify which factors have an influence on HRV. By identifying meteorological factors that could have an effect on HRV parameters, the authors considered that these findings might provide insights supporting future research on physiological responses to environmental conditions. 

Many researchers have investigated the effects of meteorological factors on certain diseases such as papers mentioned in the introduction, generally utilizing qualitative data sources, including questionnaires and diaries. Few researchers have examined the impact of various meteorological factors on quantitative biological indicators like HRV parameters fluctuations. The effects of weather elements could be analyzed by using SSM, which is capable to account for time-dependent patterns.

Building on these key findings, we interpret the significance of each meteorological factor by exploring how variations correspond to changes in HRV parameters, as indicated by the MAP estimation values. Specifically, a 1-sigma increase in each meteorological factor corresponds to a MAP estimation values change in HRV, providing a basis for assessing the relative influence of each weather element. Below, we discuss the results and their physical implications, focusing on the key meteorological factors and their potential impacts on HRV parameters.

Temperature, including mean, maximum, and minimum values, emerge as a significant factor influencing HRV parameters. For example, for heart rate, a 1-sigma increase in mean and maximum temperature was associated with an increase of MAP estimation value of 1.3-1.5 bpm in heart rate. Additionally, also for several HRV parameters, some statistics of temperature tended to be estimated that the MAP estimation values were larger than the other meteorological factors,implying its impacts for our body condition change were relatively considerable. This suggests that ambient temperature may induce reactions in body thermal regulation such as SNS. In general, temperature shows more substantial effects on our body than other meteorological factors, which might be explained by homeostasis. Keeping our body temperature constantly is essential in human survival, including sweating in human for heat-defence response [skin temp]. In many cases, the ambient temperature works as an element which could stress our human body, especially people suffering from certain diseases [between extreme]. T. Haritini et al. have examined an association between extreme temperatures and public health in Cyprus, concluding the mortality was strongly associated with high temperature weather [health impact assess]. Based on those previous studies, this study's results were consistent with them and reasonable.

Relative humidity, including mean and minimum, showed relatively larger estimation values. For instance, a 1-sigma increase in mean relative humidity would be related to an increase 0.6 ms for SDNN. Although the MAP estimation values for all HRV parameters were not prominent, they were relatively larger compared to the other meteorological factors, and the credible intervals were calculated as constantly positive/negative for heart rate, SDNN, and VLF. These findings may indicate relative humidity have larger impacts on our health condition. Jane W et al. stated that exposure to higher levels of relative humidity would worse heat stress by decreasing sweat regulation function [humidity's role]. Additionally, William G et al. examined the relationship between chronic pain and weather, concluding one of associated weather elements was humidity [how the weather affects]. Based on those previous studies, our discussion is reasonable and consistent with those, making sure the relationship between them is clear.

Sea-level atmospheric pressure, including mean and minimum, was estimated that it had a constantly positive credible interval for only VLF, indicating a 1-sigma increase in mean sea-level atmospheric pressure is could be related to an increase about 2.8$m^2$. For some HRV parameters, the credible intervals were slightly skewed toward positive/negative range, however, it cannot be said that there were pronounced effects by sea-level pressure from the results. Nevertheless, even though the effects were estimated small, it should not be neglected. Indeed, numerous of people think atmospheric pressure is the most related factor which could cause their weather-related symptoms [weathernews]. In addition, Sato J et al. showed lowering atmospheric pressure could cause aggravation of pain-related behavior in mice \cite{Sato_2019}. Therefore, study designs such as model structures and data collection methods should be considered to take into account that facts in further studies.

Precipitation, including total and hourly maximum, showed consistently positive/negative credible intervals and relatively larger MAP estimation values for several HRV parameters. For example, a 1-sigma decrease in total precipitation could be related to an increase 0.2 bpm for heart rate. Especially, precipitation was only one meteorological factor that was estimated constant positive/negative credible interval for LF and HF, suggesting it was more important weather element for those HRV parameters. Generally, rainfall affects on various health condition changes. Nassikas NJ et al. examined relationship between precipitation and respiratory health, arguing that greater precipitation might cause airway inflammation among patients with asthma [precipitation and adolescent]. Additionally, Deng X et al. investigated what weather condition could trigger mental disorders, concluding one of those was rainfall [identifying join impacts]. From these previous studies, rainfall is one of meteorological factors which has an impact on our health condition, and our results were partially consistent with those previous studies.

上記で述べた要素の中でも特に，気温，湿度，降水量，風速，降雪のなかにHRやSDNN，HFのような自律神経の働きのindicatorでもあるHRVパラメータに影響しているという結果が出ている．この発見はある気象要因が自律神経に関係があると主張している先行研究とも矛盾がなく，その仮説を強めるものとなっている．マウスとか出す？
