\chapter{Limitations and Future Works}

In this study, only one subject participated in the ECG data measurement, which may introduce some limitations due to the study condition. One of possible limitations is the difficulty in generalizing the results to other individuals, as the degree of health condition variability can depend on individual characteristics. For instance, as introduced at the beginning, sensitivity to meteorological factors' fluctuation would be different between male and female \cite{Lee_2018}.

Besides, the ECG data were measured while the subject was taking bath in a bathtub. Although the method had various advantages for measuring biosignals in daily life, the ECG data were possibly influenced by the bathing effect. Some studies have evaluated the effect of bathing on the fluctuation of HRV parameters and conducted that it had significant impacts on HRV parameters change, such as increased SNS activities causing an increase in HR by 20-30 bpm \cite{Yoshimura_1995, Takako_1996}. Indeed, one of the HRV parameters used in this analysis, pNN50, often took values close to zero. This may have prevented reliable estimation in the model used in this study.
