\chapter{Limitations}

In this study, only one subject participated in the ECG data measurement, which may introduce some limitations due to the study condition. One of possible limitations is the difficulty in generalizing the results to other individuals, as the degree of health condition variability can depend on individual characteristics. For instance, as introduced at the beginning, sensitivity to meteorological factors' fluctuation would be different between male and female \cite{Lee_2018}.

Besides, the ECG data were measured while the subject was taking bath in a bathtub. Although the method had various advantages for measuring biosignals in daily life, the ECG data were possibly influenced by the bathing effect. Some studies have evaluated the effect of bathing on HRV parameters' fluctuation, concluding that it had a significant impact on HRV parameters change such as an increase in SNS activities and heart rate.
