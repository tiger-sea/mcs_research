\section{Limitation}

In this study, only one subject participated in the measurement of ECG data. That may cause some problems due to that study condition. One of possible problems is that the results could not generalize to other people, because the extent of health condition change differs person to person. For instance, sensitivity towards meteorological factors' fluctuation would be different between male and female [xxx]. (この話どこかで出すっけ?) Additionally, residence area could be effective factor on meteoropathy, because weather traits are different in every area.

Besides, the ECG data were measured while the subject was taking bath in bathtub, namely, the ECG data was possively affected by bathing effect.
