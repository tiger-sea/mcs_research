# 📝Research for master's paper

## 💡Items

- Ideas in my brain

- Draft of my paper (coming soon, soon)

## 🌲Branches

- __main__: Full version if integration in dev branch looks fine.

- __dev__ : dev branch gathers feature/* branches if feature/* branches look good and acceptable.

- __feature__: feature/* branches comprise several sections of my paper, which are places to keep my ideas/draft.

## 🐧Rules

- Work in feature/* branches, gather them into dev branch, check dev branch, and send to main.

- Ideas should be placed on the most possible section's branch (feature/"secition's name").

- The feature would be merged with dev branch if they look good and acceptable🎁

- Stay healthy.
